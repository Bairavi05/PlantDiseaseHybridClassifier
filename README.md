# Plant Disease Classification with Hybrid Model (VGG19 + ResNet)

This repository contains a hybrid plant disease classification model using VGG19 and ResNet architectures, integrated with a Flask web application. The model predicts whether a plant is infected or not based on the input image.

## Features

- **Hybrid Model**: Uses a combination of VGG19 and ResNet architectures for improved plant disease classification accuracy.
- **Flask Web Application**: A simple web interface where users can upload an image of a plant leaf and get a prediction on whether the plant is infected or healthy.
- **Image Classification**: The model classifies plant leaves into two categories: infected or healthy.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:
